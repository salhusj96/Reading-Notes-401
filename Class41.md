# **What is penetration testing?**
- a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities
  - In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF)
- can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems, (e.g., application protocol interfaces (APIs), frontend/backend servers) to uncover vulnerabilities
## **Penetration testing stages**
1. Planning and reconnaissance
   1. Defining the scope and goals of a test
   2. Gathering intelligence
2. Scanning
   1. Static analysis – Inspecting an application’s code to estimate the way it behaves while running
   2. Dynamic analysis – Inspecting an application’s code in a running state
3. Gaining Access
   1. cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target’s vulnerabilities
4. Maintaining access
   1. imitate advanced persistent threats, which often remain in a system for months in order to steal an organization’s most sensitive data
5. Analysis
   1. Specific vulnerabilities that were exploited
   2. Sensitive data that was accessed
   3. The amount of time the pen tester was able to remain in the system undetected
## **Penetration testing methods**
- External testing
  - target the assets of a company that are visible on the internet, e.g., the web application itself, the company website, and email and domain name servers
- Internal testing
  - access to an application behind its firewall simulates an attack by a malicious insider
- Blind testing
  - tester is only given the name of the enterprise that’s being targeted
- Double-blind testing
  - security personnel have no prior knowledge of the simulated attack
- Targeted testing
  - both the tester and security personnel work together and keep each other appraised of their movements
