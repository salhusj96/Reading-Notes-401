# **Data At Rest vs. Data In Transit**
## **Definitions**
- **Data in Transit**
  - Data actively moving from one location to another such as across the internet or through a private network
  - Data protection in transit is the protection of this data while it’s traveling from network to network or being transferred
- **Data at Rest**
  - Data that is not actively moving from device to device or network to network such as data stored on a hard drive, laptop, flash drive, or archived/stored
  - Data protection at rest aims to secure inactive data stored on any device or network
## **The Role of Encryption**
- Data can be exposed to risks both in transit and at rest and requires protection in both states
- enterprises often choose to encrypt sensitive data prior to moving and/or use encrypted connections
  - HTTPS, SSL, TLS, FTPS, etc
- enterprises can simply encrypt sensitive files prior to storing them and/or choose to encrypt the storage drive itself
## **Best Practices**
- Implement robust network security controls to help protect data in transit. Firewalls, Network Access Control, etc
- Don’t rely on reactive security to protect your valuable company data
- Choose data protection solutions with policies that enable user prompting, blocking, or automatic encryption for sensitive data in transit
- Create policies for systematically categorizing and classifying all company data, no matter where it resides
