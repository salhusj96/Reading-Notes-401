# **What is computer forensics?**
- computer forensics is reactionary in nature
- computer forensics experts focus on how to move forward once a hacker has gotten in
- Forensic specialists will help determine how a breach happened in a computer systemâ€”the main focus of these experts is to look at digital breaches and hacks that have already happened, and learn from them for the future
## **Why is cyber forensics important?**
- In the first half of 2019 alone there were over 3,800 publicly disclosed security breaches, with over 4 million records exposed
- There is a new hacker attack every 39 seconds, and 300,000 new malware programs are created every day
- Cyber forensics is focused on helping us recover and learn from past hacking to propel a more secure future
