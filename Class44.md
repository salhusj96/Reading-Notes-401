# **What is Metasploit?**
- a penetration testing framework that makes hacking simple
- an essential tool for many attackers and defenders
  - pentesting once involved a lot of repetitive labor that Metasploit now automates
## **History of Metasploit**
- HD Moore began working on Metasploit in the early oughts, and released 1.0, written in Perl, in 2003
  - has grown dramatically since then, from the original 11 exploits the project came with to more than 1,500 now, plus around 500 payloads
- Security outfit Rapid7 acquired both Metasploit and Moore in 2009
  - Moore left the project in 2016
- Metasploit has since become the de facto framework for exploit development
  - it is common for zero day reports to include a Metasploit module as proof of concept
## **How to use Metasploit**
- Pretty much every reconnaissance tool you can think of integrates with Metasploit
- Once you've identified a weakness, hunt through Metasploit's large and extensible database for an exploit
- Pair the exploit with a payload to suit the task at hand
- Once on a target machine, Metasploit's quiver contains a full suite of post-exploitation tools, including privilege escalation, pass the hash, packet sniffing, screen capture, keyloggers, and pivoting tools
  - can also set up a persistent backdoor in case the machine in question gets rebooted
- The framework is modular and easily extensible and enjoys an active community
