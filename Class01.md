# **The ultimate guide to SOC 2 compliance**
## **The Basics**
- SOC 2 compliance describes a framework for an organization to prioritize six different key attributes:
  - Security
  - Availability
  - Processing
  - Integrity
  - Confidentiality
  - Privacy
- Applies to any service provider that stores customer data in the cloud.
  - Ex: A SaaS business
## **SOC Audits**
- Organized around 5 'trust principles':
  - Security: The foundational security principle, common to all audits.
  - Confidentiality: Protection from unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.
  - Availability: Protection that systems or data will be available as agreed or required.
  - Integrity: Protection that systems or data are not changed in an unauthorized manner.
  - Privacy: The use, collection, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information is protected.
- Companies spend 6-12 months focused on preparation to achieve SOC 2 compliance.
  - Includes identifying systems in the scope of the audit, developing policy/procedure, and implementing new security controls for risk reduction.
## **Audit Types**
- SOC 2 Type I: An audit conducted against the Trust Services Criteria standard at a single point in time.
- SOC 2 Type II: An audit conducted against the Trust Service Criteria standard over a period of time.
## **The SOC 2 Pyramid**
- Foundation (Security Policy): *What* is done.
  - Execution (Security Procedure): *How* it is done.
    - Proof (Documentation): *Proof* it is done.
