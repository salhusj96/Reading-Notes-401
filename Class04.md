# **CIS Benchmarks**
## **What are CIS Benchmarks?**
- published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS)
- documented industry best practices for securely configuring IT systems, software, and networks
- more than 140 CIS Benchmarks in total, spanning across seven core technology categories
## **About the Center for Internet Security (CIS)**
- a nonprofit organization established in October 2000
- driven by a global IT community with the common goal of identifying, developing, validating, promoting, and sustaining best practice solutions for cyber defense
- has produced and distributed several free tools and solutions for enterprises of all sizes, designed to strengthen their cybersecurity readiness.
## **How are CIS Benchmarks organized?**
- Each CIS Benchmark includes multiple configuration recommendations based on one of two profile levels
  - **Level 1 benchmark profiles**
    - cover base-level configurations that are easier to implement and have minimal impact on business functionality
  - **Level 2 benchmark profiles**
    - intended for high-security environments and require more coordination and planning to implement with minimal business disruption
- There are seven (7) core categories of CIS Benchmarks:
    1. Operating systems benchmarks
    2. Server software benchmarks
    3. Cloud provider benchmarks
    4. Mobile device benchmarks
    5. Network device benchmarks
    6. Desktop software benchmarks
    7. Multi-function print device benchmarks
## **CIS Hardened Images**
- CIS also offers pre-configured Hardened Images that enable enterprises to perform computing operations cost-effectively without needing to invest in additional hardware or software
- Hardened images are much more secure than standard virtual images, and they significantly limit the security vulnerabilities that can lead to a cyberattack.
  - designed and configured in compliance with CIS Benchmarks and Controls and have been recognized to be fully compliant with various regulatory compliance organizations
## **CIS Benchmarks and regulatory compliance**
- aligns closely with security and data privacy regulatory frameworks including:
  - NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Frameworl 
  - PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) (PCI DSS)
  - HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
  - ISO/EIC 2700
## **Benefits of CIS Benchmarks**
- CIS Benchmarks recommendations offer the following:
  - The collected expertise of a global community of IT and cybersecurity professionals.
  - Regularly updated, step-by-step guidance for securing every area of the IT infrastructure.
  - Compliance management consistency.
  - A flexibility template for securely adopting new cloud services and for executing digital transformation strategies.
  - Easy-to-deploy configurations for improved operational efficiency and sustainability.
