# **Understanding SQL Injection, Identification and Prevention**
- SQL Injection attacks are one of those situations where the outcome can be wildly disproportionate to the amount of effort that went into executing it
## **Why SQL Injection Matters**
- Standardized query language (SQL) is the dominant method of inserting, filtering and retrieving information from a database
- armed with literally nothing but a web browser, some basic SQL knowledge and an internet connection, an attacker can exploit flaws in your web application – extracting user data, discovering or resetting credentials and using it as a launch point for deeper assaults on your network
## **SQL and Sysadmins**
- Necessary to have some SQL Basics firmly in mind when discussing SQL Injection attacks
  - will help identify vulnerabilities your own applications
## **What is SQL?**
- NOT a Programming Language but essentially is a powerful language unto itself
## **What’s a Database Table?**
- the fundamental building block of how data is structured in a database
- At its core, a table is simply a list of information
## **What are the basic SQL Commands?**
- SQL commands to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) the information inside of your tables
