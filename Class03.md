# **Security Risk Management**
- "Risk management involves comprehensive understanding, analysis and mitigation of risk to help organizations achieve their information security objective."
- "Risk is fundamentally inherent in every aspect of information security decisions and thus risk management concepts help aid each decision to be effective in nature."
## **CISSP domain 1: Security and risk management**
- Understand, adhere to and promote professional ethics
- Understand and apply security concepts
- Evaluate and apply security governance principles
- Determine compliance and other requirements
- Understand legal and regulatory issues that pertain to information security in a holistic context
- Understand requirements for investigation types (i.e., administrative, criminal, civil, regulatory, industry standards)
- Develop, document, and implement security policy, standards, procedures and guidelines
- Identify, analyze and prioritize Business Continuity (BC) requirements
- Contribute to and enforce personnel security policies and procedures
- Understand and apply risk management concepts
- Understand and apply threat modeling concepts and methodologies
- Apply Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) concepts
- Establish and maintain a security awareness, education and training program
## **Goals of a security model**
- Have controls in place to support the mission of the organization.
- All the decisions should be based on the risk tolerance of the organization.
### **Strategy leads to tactics, tactics lead to operations**
- **Operational goals**: Daily goals, or operational goals, focus on productivity and task-oriented activities to ensure the companyâ€™s functionality in a smooth and predictable manner. Operational goals may include patching computers as needed, supporting users, updating anti-virus signatures, and maintaining the overall network on a daily basis.
- **Tactical goals**: Corresponding mid-term goals, or tactical goals, could involve moving computers into domains, installing firewalls and segregating the network by creating a demilitarized zone. Other tactical goals could include integrating all workstations and resources into one domain so more central control can be achieved.
- **Strategic goals**: A long-term goal, or strategic goal, may involve moving all the branches from dedicated communication lines to frame relay, implementing IPSec virtual private networks (VPNs) for all remote users instead of dial-up entry, and integrating wireless technology with the comprehensive security solutions and controls existing within the environment.
## **CIA Triad**
1. **Confidentiality:** Prevent unauthorized disclosure
   - **Social engineering:** Training and awareness, defining separation of duties at the tactical level, enforcing policies and conducting vulnerability assessments
   - **Media reuse:** Proper sanitization strategies
   - **Eavesdropping:** Use of encryption and keeping sensitive information off the network with adequate access controls
2. **Integrity:** Detect modification of information
   - Implement encryption using integrity-based algorithms
   - Prevent intentional or malicious modification (message digest, MAC, digital signatures)
3. **Availability:** Provide timely and reliable access to resources
   - Prevent single point of failure
   - Comprehensive fault tolerance (data, hard drives, servers, network links, etc.)
## **Best practices to support Risk Management**
- Every decision starts with looking at risk.
- Determine the value of your assets.
- Evaluate and identify cost-effective solutions to reduce risk to an acceptable level.
- Keep in mind that safeguards are proactive and countermeasures are reactive.
The following definitions are crucial for risk management:
- **Asset:** Anything of value to the company
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness, the absence of a safeguard
- **Threat:** Things that could pose a risk to all or part of an asset
- **Threat agent:** The entity which carries out the attack
- **Exploit:** An instance of compromise
- **Risk:** The probability of a threat materializing
- **Controls:** Physical, administrative and technical protections (including both safeguards and countermeasures)
## **The Lifecycle of Risk Management**
1. **Risk assessment:** Categorize, classify and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats and vulnerabilities.
2. **Risk analysis:** Both qualitative and quantitative.
3. **Risk mitigation/response:** Includes reducing or avoiding risk, transferring risk, and accepting or rejecting risk.
## **Security Governance and Policy**
- To achieve security governance, security blueprints have to be created to allow organizations to implement practices and procedures to support their security goals and the overall mission of the organizations.
## **Security Management**
- Security needs to be directed and supported by top management, referred to as the top-down approach. 
- Most companies follow a bottom-up approach, where the IT department takes security seriously and attempts to develop a security program. 
  - This approach usually will not provide those individuals with the necessary funds, support, resources, or attention.
