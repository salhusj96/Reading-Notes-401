# **What Is Threat Hunting?**
- Threat Hunting is a proactive method of seeking indicators of compromise in any number of given systems before an alert is sounded within a SIEM.
# **Why do we need Threat Hunting?**
- There is often times a long gap between an initial compromise and when a threat/attack occurs on a given system.
- Log analysis has been shown in recent studies to only catch 2.5% of actual threats before they do their damage.
- Pro-active threat-hunting on a daily basis improves overall security of the network through active surveillance of potential targets and vectors.
