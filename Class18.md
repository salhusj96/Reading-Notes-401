# **Introduction to AWS CloudWatch**
## **What is it?**
- a service used for real-time monitoring AWS resources like EC2 instances, EBS, RDS, load balancer, lambda, Cognito, S3, etc.
- can be used for monitoring on-prem resources
  - service exists to collect & track matrices, monitor log files, and set alarms
## **CloudWatch Event**
- allows users to consume a near real-time stream of events like changes to their AWS environment
  - can trigger notification services like SNS, SMS, etc. or can trigger other AWS services like Lambda, SSM, Step
  - can create a custom role to trigger targeted AWS resources for automation purposes based on event, role or time schedule
- **Events;** represented by the JSON script, can happen from within AWS when the resource changes its state or events are generated by API calls and console sign-ins
- **Rules;** match incoming events and route them to one or more targets or processing
- **Targets;** process events and are specified within the rules
## **CloudWatch Agent**
- can be configured on the EC2 instances to send Custom Metrics to CloudWatch
- supports multiple operating systems like Amazon Linux, CentOS, Red hat, Windows Server (2008 onwards), Debian, Ubuntu OS.
- collects live metrics from the server and send these custom & detailed data to CloudWatch Dashboard
## **CloudWatch Alarm**
- based on target CloudWatch metrics or the result of a math expression based on CloudWatch metrics
- performs one or multiple actions based on metric value or specified matrices condition reaching a threshold over several time periods
## **CloudWatch Logs**
- helps users to access, monitor & store access log files from AWS resources like EC2, Lambda functions, CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources
- centralize the logs from all your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service
- offers near real-time monitoring and users can search, filter for specific phrases, values or patterns
  - managed service that can be provisioned without extra purchases from within your AWS accounts
## **CloudWatch Anomaly Detection**
- CloudWatch applies statistical and machine learning algorithms and that continuously analyze metrics of systems or applications and determine normal baselines, and surface inconsistency with minimal user involvement
- Capabilities:
  - Learn and model the expected behavior of a metric based on prior data
  - Calculate expected values and generates the Anomaly Detection band.
  - Enable you to create alarms based on the Anomaly Detection band and remediate detected anomalies
  - AWS API & CloudFormation support
