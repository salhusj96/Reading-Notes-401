# **What is a Security Operations Center?**
## **SOC**
- Identifies and analyzes threats
- Investigates the source and reports vulnerabilities
- Plans how to prevent similar occurrences in the future
## **GSOC**
- Global Security Operations Center
- Coordinates ofgfices around the world
- Prevents each location from repeating tasks and functions
- Reduces overhead

## **What are the three most common SOC types?**
- **Internal SOCs:** The internal SOC comprises a physical room where all the action takes place, usually with a full-time staff based on-premises.
- **Virtual SOCs:** Virtual SOCs are not on-premises and are made up of part-time or contracted workers who work together in a coordinated manner to resolve issues as needed. The SOC and the organization set parameters and guidelines for how the relationship will work, and how much support the SOC offers can vary depending on the needs of the organization.
- **Outsourced SOCs:** In an outsourced SOC, some or all functions are managed by an external managed security service provider (MSSP) that specializes in security analysis and response. Sometimes these companies provide specific services to support an internal SOC, and sometimes they handle everything.
## **How does a SOC work?**
- Most SOCs adopt a hierarchical approach to manage security issues, where analysts and engineers are categorized based on their skill set and experience
  - **Level 1:** The first line of incident responders. These security professionals watch for alerts and determine each alert’s urgency as well as when to move it up to Level 2. Level 1 personnel may also manage security tools and run regular reports.
  - **Level 2:** These personnel usually have more expertise, so they can quickly get to the root of the problem and assess which part of the infrastructure is under attack. They will follow procedures to remediate the problem and repair any fallout, as well as flag issues for additional investigation.
  - **Level 3:** At this level, personnel consist of high-level expert security analysts who are actively searching for vulnerabilities within the network. They will use advanced threat detection tools to diagnose weaknesses and make recommendations for improving the organization’s overall security. Within this group, you might also find specialists, such as forensic investigators, compliance auditors or cybersecurity analysts.
  - **Level 4:** This level consists of high-level managers and chief officers with the most years of experience. This group oversees all SOC team activities and is responsible for hiring and training, plus evaluating individual and overall performance. Level 4s step in during crises, and, specifically, serve as the liaison between the SOC team and the rest of the organization. They are also responsible for ensuring compliance with organization, industry and government regulations.
