# **Ethical hacking: Log tampering**
## **The Process**
1. Disable auditing
   - if logging is turned off, there will be no trail of evidence
   - can use the command line favorite, Auditpol, which will not only allow you to disable auditing but will also allow you to see the level of logging that the organizationâ€™s system administrator has set
2. Clearing logs
   - Clearlogs.exe
   - Meterpreter
   - Windows Event Viewer
   - Linux systems
3. Modifying logs
   - text editor may be needed to modify logs
4. Erasing command history
   - retained history of bash commands is found in the file ~/.bash_history
