# **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
## **What is a virtual private cloud (VPC)?**
- a public cloud offering that lets an enterprise establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared public cloud infrastructure
- gives an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud
## **Features**
- gives customers many of the advantages of private clouds, while leveraging public cloud resources and savings
  - **Agility:** Control the size of your virtual network and deploy cloud resources whenever your business needs them. You can scale these resources dynamically and in real-time.
  - **Availability:** Redundant resources and highly fault-tolerant availability zone architectures mean your applications and workloads are highly available.
  - **Security:** Because the VPC is a logically isolated network, your data and applications won’t share space or mix with those of the cloud provider’s other customers. You have full control over how resources and workloads are accessed, and by whom.
  - **Affordability:** VPC customers can take advantage of the public cloud’s cost-effectiveness, such as saving on hardware costs, labor times, and other resources.
## **Benefits**
- **Flexible business growth**
- **Satisfied customers**
- **Reduced risk across the entire data lifecycle**
- **More resources to channel toward business innovation**
## **Architecture**
- can deploy cloud resources into your own isolated virtual network
- These cloud resources fall into three categories:
  - **Compute**
  - **Storage**
  - **Networking**
## **Three-tier architecture**
- **Presentation:** takes requests from web browsers and presents information created by, or stored within, the other layers to end users
- **Application:** houses the business logic and is where most processing takes place
- **Database:** comprised of database servers that store the data processed in the application tier
## **Security**
- **Access control lists (ACLs):**
  - a list of rules that limit who can access a particular subnet within your VPC
  - defines the set of IP addresses or applications granted access to it
- **Security groups:**
  - can create groups of resources and assign uniform access rules to them
