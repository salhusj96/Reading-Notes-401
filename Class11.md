# **Is Cybersecurity Automation The Future?**
## **What Is Cybersecurity Automation?**
- Cybersecurity products designed to automate specific processes, widespread usage in modern day
- vulnerability management products can be configured to automatically detect and scan devices on an enterprise network
- When discussing new automation practices, industry experts are generally referring to tools like
  - security automation and orchestration (SOAR) products
  - robotic process automation (RPA)
  - custom-developed software and code that automate processes and perform analysis
## **Why Cybersecurity Automation?**
- Organizations are increasingly placing an emphasis on their digital transformation activities and technical complexity of their enterprise
- Increasing organizational complexity can lead to significant risk if cybersecurity cannot sufficiently manage the changing environment
- Paired with human error and the insurmountable amount of data to manage, it is inevitable that a potential threat will slip through the cracks
## **What Is The Benefit Of Automation?**
- Automation will allow the cybersecurity team to focus on designing and implementing cybersecurity strategies, including initiatives such as zero trust and cyber hygiene within the enterprise
- The identified deficiencies from your automation efforts will assist your technical and mission teams by providing more repeatable and actionable insight into the enterprise environment leading to fewer vulnerabilities
- Automation will become an important part of the cybersecurity program requiring its own resources related to ongoing and iterative automation design and implementation
